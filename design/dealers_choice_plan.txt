Splash.Stage => Game.Stage transition via slots and router add vuex

Then flesh out a complete interface including admin
Figure out what's client side and what's server side
Figure out the admin interface and how the state and rules get passed to the bots
At any point players can sit out a hand to answer the phone take care of the kids etc
So the state needs to include everything.
hub and spoke using hapi as the hub unless everything is client side for testing

To start we'll just stub out
5 dogs in 5 card bluff
no responsiveness no security or admin
a single basic transition from splash to table
at the table we'll have 5 dogs
each with a name, a picture, a stack of 500 bones, and a hand
one marked as the dealer
A pot in the middle
As each player bets their ammount is put in front of them and the pot aggregates them
Possibly like +20 ^20 5 5 20^30 = 100 (for bet 20 raise 20 pay 5 pay 5 call 20 and raise 30)
When it's your turn you can check, call or raise the max bet if < max raises

Use discourse as a clubhouse
Host via AWS
Register a player, a player can play by hand
or he or she can register an ip address and rest interface
to call for his or her bot that can be written in any language.



We pass them rules in a json spec for the various games and they implement ai bots to play the games
If a game isn't covered that bot sits out for that game

We validate inputs and outputs and referee the games and track results
We can do analasis on the ai's and look for patterns, flaws and strengths of different appoaches.
Talky voice chat with a text chat backup

Admin and hosting features
================
A host can schedule a game on a calendar, invite players, manage a clubhouse, assign a banker
A host can choose the games available to a table.
A host can enforce that each game is played for a round of deals or freestyle.
A banker can give  a player chips either during a game or outside of a game
The system tracks transfers for them
A host can restrict a table to a set number of games
A host can make a table freestyle or full rounds,
or specify full rounds just for some games (those with dealer advantages)
A host can force a player to check or fold if need be or set a timer to do so automatically, with faster repeating.

Basic Setup
================
A table with x players each with y stacks
Dealer rotates
Any player can take a game definition copy it, customize it and give it a new name
When a dealer announces a game
as the cards are being dealt
the rules appear in an attractive marquee style (rocky and bullwinkle show)
currentDealer rotates
chooses a game, shuffles, deals

betting begins to the dealers left

check or bet amt adds to currentMatch

if myBet < currentMatch
	and if raises < maxRaises
		then call, raise or fold are options
		where raise is amt up to maxRaise
	else just call or fold
else
	check or bet amt raises < maxRaises up to maxRaise

when everyone has either called or folded or is lastBetter
then we have a showdown

After showdown
	winner receives pot ( or ties split pot )
	if someone is out of bones they are out ( possibly buy in as a b-feature )
	if all are out
		declare a winner
	else
		increment the dealer
