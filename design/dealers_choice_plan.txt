flesh out a complete interface including admin for 5 card bluff
Figure out what's client side and what's server side
Figure out the admin interface and how the state and rules get passed to the bots
At any point players can sit out a hand to answer the phone take care of the kids etc
So the state needs to include everything.
hub and spoke using hapi as the hub unless everything is client side for testing

As each player bets their amount is put in front of them and the pot aggregates them
Possibly like +20 ^20 5 5 20^30 = 100 (for bet 20 raise 20 pay 5 pay 5 call 20 and raise 30)
When it's your turn you can check, call or raise the max bet if < max raises

Register a player, a player can play by hand
or he or she can register an ip address and rest interface
to call for his or her bot that can be written in any language.



We pass them rules in a json spec for the various games and they implement ai bots to play the games
If a game isn't covered that bot sits out for that game

We validate inputs and outputs and referee the games and track results
We can do analasis on the ai's and look for patterns, flaws and strengths of different appoaches.

Admin and hosting features
================
A host can schedule a game on a calendar, invite players, manage a clubhouse, assign a banker
A host can choose the games available to a table.
A host can enforce that each game is played for a round of deals or freestyle.
A banker can give  a player chips either during a game or outside of a game
The system tracks transfers for them
A host can restrict a table to a set number of games
A host can make a table freestyle or full rounds,
or specify full rounds just for some games (those with dealer advantages)
A host can force a player to check or fold if need be or set a timer to do so automatically, with faster repeating.

Basic Setup
================
A table with x players
    each with y stacks

When a host creates a game he can choose a dealer or have one assigned randomly



Any player can take a game definition copy it, customize it and give it a new name
the dealer can press "shuffle as many times as he or she wants"
The dealer presses "call game"
he or she is given a set to choose from or customize,
when the game is selected a screen announces the rules to the others
the rules appear in an attractive marquee style (rocky and bullwinkle show)
when ante's are all in the dealer presses "deal" those players are "in" for the round
cards are dealt
betting begins to the dealers left
check or bet ammmount adds to current match value
if myBet < currentMatch
if raises < maxRaises
then call, raise or fold amount up to maxRaise
else call or fold

else check or bet



betting begins to the dealers left

check or bet amt adds to currentMatch

if myBet < currentMatch
	and if raises < maxRaises
		then call, raise or fold are options
		where raise is amt up to maxRaise
	else just call or fold
else
	check or bet amt raises < maxRaises up to maxRaise

when everyone has either called or folded or is lastBetter
then we have a showdown

After showdown
	winner receives pot ( or ties split pot )
	if someone is out of bones they are out ( possibly buy in as a b-feature )
	if all are out
		declare a winner
	else
		increment the dealer
