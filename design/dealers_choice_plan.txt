To start we'll just stub out
5 dogs
in 5 card bluff
no responsiveness no security or admin
a transition, but a basic one from splash to table
at the table we'll have 5 dogs
each with a hand, a name and a stack of 500 bones

one marked as the dealer


Use discourse as a clubhouse eventually
Register a player
Possibly use github 

The player can play by hand 
or he or she can register an ip address and rest interface to call for his or her bot that can be written in any language.

We pass them rules in a json spec for the various games and they implement ai bots to play the games

We validate inputs and outputs and referee the games and track results

We can do analasis on the ai's and look for patterns, flaws and strengths of different appoaches.
